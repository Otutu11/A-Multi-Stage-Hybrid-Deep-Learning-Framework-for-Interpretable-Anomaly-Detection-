# A Multi-Stage Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Interpretable Anomaly Detection in Environmental Sensor Networks

This repository implements the framework presented in our manuscript titled "A Multi-Stage Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Interpretable Anomaly Detection in Environmental Sensor Networks." Our approach integrates convolutional and recurrent neural architectures with interpretable AI techniques for anomaly detection in real-time sensor data collected from diverse environmental settings.
🔍 Overview

Environmental sensor networks generate high-frequency data prone to anomalies due to sensor drift, environmental noise, or malicious attacks. This project presents a multi-stage hybrid deep learning (MS-HDL) architecture that performs:

    Temporal and spatial feature extraction

    Anomaly detection using unsupervised deep learning

    Interpretable analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

    Performance benchmarking on SMAP, SWaT, and Niger Delta real-world datasets

📊 Key Contributions

    Multi-Stage Pipeline combining CNNs and Bi-LSTM layers for robust temporal-spatial anomaly learning.

    Anomaly Detection Module using thresholding on reconstruction errors and predictive residuals.

    SHAP-based Interpretability to explain anomaly decisions and identify faulty sensors.

    Ablation Study & Latency Profiling for deployment in low-power IoT settings.
